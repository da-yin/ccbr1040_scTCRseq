Background:

TCR is a specific molecule on the surface of T cell, responsible for recognizing antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In humans, most of TCRs consist of α and β chains. TCR β chain is generated by the random recombination of variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments, which generates the highly variable complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) that is critical for the specificity and affinity of antigen recognition. CDR3 polymorphisms account for TCR diversity and allow T cells to target any endogenous or exogenous antigen. T cells will be specifically activated and expanded through recognizing disease-associated antigens, which lead to a skewed distribution of TCR repertoire. Hence, the analysis of TCR repertoire can be used to reflect the immune responses for patients.

Aim:

Beta5t expressed by cTECs is critical for the development of CD8 T cells. We aim to understand how TCR repertoire is formed during thymocyte development in b5t-knockout and control mice.
